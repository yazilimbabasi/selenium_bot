Hello everyone. This time I wrote a python code that automatically clicks a button on a website of our choice. 
If you follow the instructions step by step I don't think you will have any problems. 
If you want to use id_selenium, follow these instructions:

-Enter the desired internet address in the web address section.
-In the meantime, open your browser and open the address you wrote in the web address section.
-When the internet address opens, press the F12 key. Then you will see a mouse-like button on the top left of the screen that appears. Click on this button.
-Then click on the button you want to be pressed automatically. But be careful when choosing this button.
-On the previous black screen that opens, a line will be highlighted in blue. Copy the number in the id section of this line.
-Paste the number you copied into the "your id" section in the code. Then your code will be ready to use.

If you want to use class_selenium follow these instructions:

-Enter the desired internet address in the web address section.
-In the meantime, open your browser and open the address you wrote in the web address section.
-When the internet address opens, press the F12 key. Then you will see a mouse-like button on the top left of the screen that appears. Click on this button.
-Then click on the button you want to be pressed automatically. But be careful when choosing this button.
-A line will be highlighted in blue on the previous black screen that opens. Copy the text in the class section of this line.
-Paste the number you copied into the "your class" section in the code. Then your code will be ready to use.

I wish everyone good codingðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
